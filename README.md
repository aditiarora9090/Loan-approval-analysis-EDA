## Introduction

LOANS are the major requirement of the modern world. By this only, Banks get a major part of the total profit. It is beneficial for students to manage their education and living expenses, and for people to buy any kind of luxury like houses, cars, etc.

But when it comes to deciding whether the applicant’s profile is relevant to be granted with loan or not. Banks have to look after many aspects.

So, here we will be using Machine Learning with Python to ease their work and predict whether the candidate’s profile is relevant or not using key features like Marital Status, Education, Applicant Income, Credit History, etc.

## About the dataset

The dataset contains 13 features :

1. Loan: A unique id
2. Gender: Gender of the applicant Male/female
3. Married: Marital Status of the applicant, values will be Yes/ No
4. Dependents: It tells whether the applicant has any dependents or not.
5. Education: It will tell us whether the applicant is Graduated or not.
6. Self_Employed: This defines that the applicant is self-employed i.e. Yes/ No
7. ApplicantIncome: Income of applicant
8. CoapplicantIncome: Income of Co-applicant
9. LoanAmount: Loan amount (in thousands)
10. Loan_Amount_Term: Terms of loan (in months)
11. Credit_History: Credit history of individual’s repayment of their debts
12. Property_Area: Area of property i.e. Rural/Urban/Semi-urban
13. Loan_Status: Status of Loan Approved or not i.e. Y- Yes, N-No

## Exploratory Data Analysis

I have done Exploratory Data Analysis on this dataset using Matplotlib, which helped me gain various insights related to the following:

   -   Pairplot to check the relationship among variables
   -   Distribution of Loan Amount
   -   Loan demanded segregated by Gender and Education Status
   -   Loan Amount and Income of Applicants and CoApplicants
   -   Gender Distribution
   -   Dependents and Education Status
   -   Loan tenure of different Property Areas classified by Employment Status
   -   Gender Ratio and Marital Status
   -   Income wise Loan Amount
   -   Distribution of Applicant Income across Property Area and Credit History
   -   Relationship between Loan Amount and tenure of the Loan
   -   Credit History of the Applicants
   -   Loan Status categorized by Employment Status
   -   Correlation among the variables
   -   3D Scatter Plot
